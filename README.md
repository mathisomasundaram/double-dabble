# double-dabble
Implement Double dabble or shift and add-3 algorithm to convert a binary number into Binary-coded Decimal.Â  Convert the output Binary coded Decimal to Binary number using Reverse Double Dabble. Register Numbers, Shift flow, and speed of execution should be tested with 5 samples
SHIFT AND ADD 3 ALGORITHMS
STEP:1 shift the binary numbers left one bit
STEP:2 if 8 bits have taken,place,the BCD number is in the hundreds,tens and units column
STEP:3 if the binary value in any of the BCD columns is 5 or greater add 3 to that value in that BCD column
STEP:4 go to 1
